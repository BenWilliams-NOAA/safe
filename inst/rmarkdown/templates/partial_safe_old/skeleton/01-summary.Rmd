# Executive Summary

## Summary of Changes in Assessment Inputs

List of changes (if any) in the input data, including estimated catches assumed for the current year and projected catches for current year + 1 and current year + 2.

List of changes (if any) in the assessment methodology. 
**This is one of the most important sections of the SAFE report**. 
Common mistakes in this section include: 1) listing something that *has not* changed, and 2) not listing something that *has* changed.

## Area Allocation of Harvest

The following table shows the recommended ABC apportionment for `r year+1` and `r year+2`. 
The apportionment percentages are the same as in the last full assessment. 
Please refer to the 2020 full stock assessment report [@Fenske2020] for information regarding the apportionment rationale for GOA dusky rockfish.

Amendment 41 prohibited trawling in the Eastern area east of 140° W longitude. 
The ratio of biomass still obtainable in the W. Yakutat area (between 147° W and 140° W) is 0.75. 
This results in the following apportionment to the W. Yakutat area:


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\hline

 & W. Yakutat & E. Yakutat/Southeast \\
 \hline
 2022 Area ABC (t) & 427 & 142 \\
 2023 Area ABC (t) & 412 & 137 \\
